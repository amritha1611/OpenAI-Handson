# Python Compiler with OpenAI and Streamlit

This project provides a simple interface for simulating a Python compiler using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model. Users can input Python code into a Streamlit application, and the app will return the console output as if the code were executed in a Python interpreter. 

## Features
- **Interactive Code Input**: Enter Python code in a text area.
- **Simulated Execution**: View the expected Python console output generated by GPT-3.5-Turbo.
- **Streamlit Interface**: User-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

## Requirements
To run this application, you need the following:

- Python 3.7+
- Required libraries:
  - `openai`
  - `streamlit`

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-compiler.git
cd python-compiler
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip:
```bash
pip install openai streamlit
```

### Step 3: Set Up OpenAI API Key
1. Create an OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI API Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. Save the API key in a text file named `.openai_api_key.txt` under the `keys` directory:
    ```bash
    mkdir keys
    echo "your-openai-api-key" > keys/.openai_api_key.txt
    ```

### Step 4: Run the Application
Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## File Structure
```
.
├── app.py                # Main Streamlit application script
├── keys/
│   └── .openai_api_key.txt  # Contains the OpenAI API key
├── README.md             # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt      # List of dependencies (optional)
```

## How It Works
1. The application reads the OpenAI API key from the `.openai_api_key.txt` file.
2. Users enter a Python code snippet into the text area provided by Streamlit.
3. Upon clicking the "Compile" button, the code is sent to OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model with a system prompt to act as a Python compiler.
4. The model generates the expected terminal output for the code, which is displayed in the Streamlit interface.

## Example
### Input:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
### Output:
```plaintext
Hello, World!
```
